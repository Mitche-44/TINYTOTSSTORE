### Technologies Used
#### HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

- HTML provides the structure of the website, including the layout of the product grid, cart, and various sections.

- It also defines the elements such as images, text, and buttons that users interact with.

#### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

- CSS is used to style the website and make it visually appealing.

- Bright, kid-friendly colors and playful fonts are used to create a fun and welcoming atmosphere.

- Responsive design is implemented using media queries, ensuring the site works well on mobile devices.

#### JavaScript.

- JavaScript provides interactive functionality such as:

- Adding/removing products from the shopping cart.

- Displaying the total cost of the cart.

- Saving cart data in localStorage so the cart is preserved even when the user refreshes the page.
